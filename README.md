# Lana's Unisex Hair Salon Website
This website was built to develop my skills with React, and help out a local hair salon that did not have an official website.

## Project Description
This project is a static webpage that displays updated information about the salon such as location, contact info, and services + pricing. It also shows previous reviews left by clients on Yelp and Google Reviews. It was built solely using React as this is a static webpage.

## Installation
1. Open the terminal.
2. Clone the repository using ```git clone https://github.com/Justin-Phan1/lanas-unisex-hair-salon-website.git``` 
3. Navigate to the project's directory using ``` cd lanas-unisex-hair-salon-website ```
4. Install dependencies using ```
                              npm install
                              ```
5. Start the app using ```
                       npm start
                       ```
6. Open a browser and search http://localhost:3000.

### Insights Gained
While building this project, I learned how business and software engineering are related. For example, I did research on what useful information should be displayed for a hair salon, and also communicated with the salon's owner about how the salon is run. I also saw how useful software engineers can be especially, in this case, when a client is not familiar with building a website and how it can improve their business.

### Skillsets Learned 
This project allowed me to develop my knowledge with React, used JSON to handle data, and used a library (Splide) to develop a feature (reviews slider).
